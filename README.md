# CodeWars

This repo demonstrates a range of skills in Java with each file representing a different task, known as 'katas'. 
They are completed within an online integrated development environment with corresponding tests, which are ommitted in this repo. 

All the solutions in this repo are written by myself.

Each solution is a commit, unless it was edited to refactor a kata or update the repo.

The folders are split into 'kyus' which represent the difficulty of the programming challenge in ascending order 8kyu -> 1kyu.
