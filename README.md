## CodeWars Solutions & Ranking

This repo demonstrates a range of skills in Java with each file representing a different task, known as 'katas'. 
They are completed within an online integrated development environment with corresponding tests, which are ommitted in this repo. 

All the solutions in this repo are written by myself.

Each solution is a commit, unless it was edited to refactor a kata or update the repo.

Ranks are used to indicate progression and difficulty. Code Warriors complete Kata which are assigned a rank, which in turn earns them a higher rank once they complete enough of them. There are two classes of ranks, Kyu and Dan. You begin with Kyu at level 8 and work your way down to level 1. Then you progress to Dan, where you work your way up from level 1 to level 8.

## Kata Ranking (kyu)

# 4 kyu kata represent a competent programming level.
At this level the kata begin to take some serious thought to complete. They include tasks that may handle:

- Computer science concepts utilizing complex algorithms
- Advanced design patterns
- Understanding intricate business requirements
- Advanced concepts such as concurrency, parallelism, meta programming and cryptography

# 5 kyu kata represent a novice programming level.
At this level the kata are similar to 6 kyu but more challenging. It includes:

- Complex language features that require mature OOP/Functional concepts
- Advanced OOP/Functional concepts
- Complex Design Patterns
- Advanced regular expression usage

# 6 kyu kata represent a novice programming level.
At this level the kata will start to include more advanced algorithmic challenges and more complex language features. It includes:

- Complex language features (closures, scopes, monads, etc)
- Complex OOP/Functional concepts
- Basic Design Patterns
- Complex Regular Expressions

# 7 kyu kata represent a beginner programming level.
At this level the kata will generally challenge users on their core language and API reference knowledge. Tasks such as:

- Iterating arrays and returning a subset of values
- Basic data type manipulations
- Basic functional or object-oriented concepts
- Basic Regular Expressions
